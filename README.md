# Sliger.dev Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI, and react-three-fiber. Additionally other services are used for additional functionalities like emailing, for this project I went with the Sendinblue API.

## Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-designed components and a responsive grid system.
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/): A simple and customizable component library that enhances the development experience with a set of accessible and themeable UI components.
- [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber): A React renderer for three.js, enabling the creation of 3D and WebGL-powered experiences in a declarative way.
